# Ghost.NET
A .NET wrapper for Lego’s Ghost library, supporting tethered interaction with the RCX

This source code was originally part of the [AForge.NET project](https://github.com/andrewkirillov/AForge.NET);
however, the RCX code was flagged within that project as obsolete and deprecated,
so it has been copied and setup in its own repository here.
A few links will likely need to be updated.
